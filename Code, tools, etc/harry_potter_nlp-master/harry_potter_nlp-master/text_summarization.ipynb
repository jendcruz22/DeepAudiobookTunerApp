      "Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward — He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn't raise the wands in time — one of Harry's hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward, into the wall — Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\n",

      "He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts — A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack?\n",

      "He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened.\n",
      "The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said, \"Potter, in here, quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 29 - THE LOST DIADEM\n",
      "Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue.\n",
      "As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort's scream of fury vibrated inside his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 30 - THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE\n",
      "She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape — Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast — \"Minerva!\"\n",
      "There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 31 - THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS\n",
      "It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.\n",
      "The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 32 - THE ELDER WAND\n",
      "Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated.\n",
      "Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it — He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches.\n",

      "But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 34 - THE FOREST AGAIN\n",
      "Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\n",
      "The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort.\n",

      "In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle — The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye.\n",
      "With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet — Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand.\n",

      "Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward — He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn't raise the wands in time — one of Harry's hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward, into the wall — Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\n",

      "What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?\n",

      "Chapter 9 - THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n",

      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n",

      "\"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.\n",
      "A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n",

      "The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle's grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail.\n",

      "For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less.\n",

      "Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until — \n",
      "\"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters.\n",
      "The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle.\n",
      "Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch — He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.\n",

      "\n",
      "For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\n",
      ". He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!\" Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.\n",
      "Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\n",
      "\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \n",
      "Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.\n",
      "It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.\n",
      "As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.\n",
      "\"Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n",
      "\"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.\n",
      "\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks.\n",
      "\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n",
      "\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.\n",
      "\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n",
      "Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them.\n",
      "\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n",
      "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses.\n",
      "He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n",
      "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\n",
      "On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult —\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —\").\n",
      "Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n",
      "\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n",
      "Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to  block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today.\n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.\n",
      "\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n",
      "\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.\n",
      "It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\n",
      "\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry — !\" \n",
      "\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n"

      "\n",
      "He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).\n",
      "Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.\n",
      "Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk.\n",
      "\"Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago .\n",
      "I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles —\" \"It wasn't me — and how did he know?\" \"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"I told you, I didn't — but it'll take too long to explain now — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'll think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so —\" \n",
      "\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it.\n",
      "Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, 'Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" \n",
      "\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word.\n",
      "Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal.\n",
      "\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\n",
      "Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\n",
      "\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\n",
      "When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.\n",
      "\"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off.\n",
      "\"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.\n",
      "Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\" \n",
      "For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys.\n",
      "Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\n",
      "\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"  Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all.\n",
      "When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Mandrakes today.\n",
      "In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\n",
      "\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\n",
      "\"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.\n",
      "\"No — honestly — didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\n",
      "\"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).\n",
      "\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n",
      "Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle.\n",
      "\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.\n",
      "\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\n",
      "Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door.\n",
      "Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" \n"

      "\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, \"as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any — any funny stuff while she's here.\n",
      "Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (\"it's a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\"personally, I won't let any of the children out alone until he's back in Azkaban\").\n",
      "As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.\n",
      "The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.\" \"What's all that, Hermione?\" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her.\n",
      "How's he going to get it with that thing around?\" \"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand.\n",
      "\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.\n",
      "Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\n",
      "Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages.\n",
      "Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty.\n",
      "\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\n",
      "\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back.\n",
      "\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.\n",
      "\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside.\n",
      "\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks.\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n",
      "The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter!\n",
      "Ron  stared as Professor  McGonagall  ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.\n",
      "When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.\n",
      "\"What's up with you, Harry?\" \"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\n",
      "At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject.\n",
      "And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!\" Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.\n",
      "The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n",
      "\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried.\n",
      "\"Ar, maybe she's right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.\n",
      "Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.\n",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed.\n",
      "\"What's the matter, Lavender?\" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the group.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.\n",
      "\"But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know, they're Muggles, they don't really understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\" Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods.\n",
      "\"Yeah, loads,\" said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't like.\n",
      "A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.\n",
      "\"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to Hermione.\n",
      "\"Harry, listen,\" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, \"you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.\n",
      "Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black.\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table.\n",
      "\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\n",
      "Yes, I know it's a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed.\n",
      "\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support.\n",
      "\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said.\n",
